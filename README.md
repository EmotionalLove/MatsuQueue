# MatsuQueue (待つQueue)
A queue plugin for controlling the player count of survival servers

## Oh sh*t there's nothing here
Yeah it's like 3AM rn ;-;, I'll write stuff like later when I sleep. For now just read over CommentedDefaultConfig.yml. Also I still haven't written the Bukkit companion plugin so like this isn't even done yet smh.

## A note on bugs
Don't expect anything to be perfect yet ;p

## //todo
- ping the destination server before moving the player in case it's down. if it's down just keep periodically trying to join it and broadcast a notification in chat to all waiting players that the queue will begin moving again when the server is back up.

- maybe make a way to hold you spot for a few seconds in case you accidentally disconnected/crashed/etc?

- add priority integer to slot groups
